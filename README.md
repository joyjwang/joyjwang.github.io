Thesis:
How did states handle COVID in comparison with each other?

Null:
- No states did better than the other.
- Blue states do better than red states.

Role division
- joy: predict positive to death, predict positive to hospitalization rates, predict positive to recovered, violin plots for each month?
- stephanie: machine learning, predict 51st state, clustering around nearby states
- lucinda: compare states to see how they do based on red/blue alignment

thoughts from Final Project Workshop 
- make sure to clearly state: what's your hypothesis (null/alternate)?
- we probably want to make sure we clearly connect each section together in our write up so the whole project is cohesive
- final project is called a 'tutorial' -- when you read it, you should learn from it (so explanation/writeup is v important)
